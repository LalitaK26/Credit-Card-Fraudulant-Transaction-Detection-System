# Credit-Card-Fraudulant-Transaction-Detection-Model

#  Credit card fraud is a serious problem, and detecting fraudulent transactions quickly is essential. We will show you how to use Python and machine learning algorithms to detect fraud in credit card transactions. We will start by exploring the data and preprocessing it for training. Then, we will build and train our model using a supervised learning approach.
